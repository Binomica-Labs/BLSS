# Binomics Labs Software Suite

A suite of software for use in biological exploration. Open source, of course! The suite is coded in C# using the Visual Studio Community Edition IDE and intended to be used on Windows. Feel free to fork to your heart's content and please pardon the paltry coding practices...they will get better with time! 

## Modules
-----------------------------------------------
#### Infinite Discovery Machine Simulator 
Produces an in-silico run of the IDM tool chain used to generate random protein sequences from datasets of known and/or random DNA.

#### Codon Bias Analyzer
Analyzes how often each of the 64 DNA triplet codons occur in a given dataset of protein coding sequences. It can also output a codon bias table in the Kazusa format used by many bioinformatics tools.

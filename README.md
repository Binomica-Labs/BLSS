# Binomics Labs Software Suite

A suite of software for use in biological exploration. Open source, of course! As of October 2018, the only project of this suite is the Infinite Discovery Machine Simulator wich produces an in-silico run of the IDM tool chain used to generate random protein sequences from datasets of known and/or random DNA. The suite is coded in C# using the Visual Studio Community Edition IDE and intended to be used on Windows. Feel free to fork to your heart's content and please pardon the paltry coding practices...they will get better with time!
